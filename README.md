# The Lonely Mountain Project

## In Development

A gamified fitness challenge app that integrates with the Strava API. When a user opts in, it tracks cumulative distance from runs, hikes, or ski tours and maps progress against Bilbo's journey in The Hobbit.
Key Features:

- Calculates the user's cumulative distance
- Determines the next checkpoint along Bilbo's route
- Updates activity descriptions with progress, checkpoints reached, and Tolkien-themed facts
- Web dashboard and database-backed backend track progress
- AI components enhance personalization with tailored commentary and summaries
